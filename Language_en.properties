ExtMessage=Containers have gone live on Bluemix.  If you were a participant in the beta program please see the <a href="https://containers.ng.bluemix.net/beta-migration" target="_blank">migration guide</a>.  The repositories for your organization will move from registry-ice.ng.bluemix.net/[betaNameSpace] to registry.ng.bluemix.net/[newNameSpace]. You may need to update your Dockerfiles' FROM statements to reflect the updated repositories.  <br><br>For information and a quick-start guide view our <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_single_pipeline_ov.html#container_single_pipeline_build" target="_blank">documentation</a> or try one of our example projects and pipelines found on <a href="https://github.com/Puquios" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  

IMAGE_NAME_KEY=Image Name 
IMAGE_NAME_DESC=The base name of the Docker Image to be created.  This will be used for the name of the built image in the Registry, and in the names for any containers.  This can be set on the job or on as an envrironment property on the stage. 
COMMAND_KEY=Build Script 
COMMAND_DESC=Example script to build a Docker Image on the IBM Container Service.  Use this as is, or update it based on your needs. 

CACHE_KEY=Use cached layers
